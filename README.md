This repository provides julia code to run dueling bandit algorithms in (non-stationary) synthetic environments. It provides the code to reproduce the experimental results of the paper [When Can We Track Significant Preference Shifts in Dueling Bandits?](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=LjWJLkSpjh) by Joe Suk and Arpit Agarwal, published in _NeurIPS_ 2023.

The julia code is mostly adapted from the [PiecewiseStationaryBandits GitHub repository](https://github.com/EmilieKaufmann/PiecewiseStationaryBandits) by Emilie Kaufmann.

See the **dueling_experiment.ipynb** file to run experiments and for installation of required julia packages.
